### Diego Petrucci

Hi, I'm Diego â€” and iOS engineer at [Plum](https://withplum.com), curating the Bills & Offers (formerly Lost Money) section. Previously, I've worked at [babylon health](https://www.babylonhealth.com) on the NHS GP at Hand service, Bupa, Healthcheck, and Monitor teams. I live in London, UK, but am originally from Tuscany, in Italy. Find me dancing salsa and bachata after work! ðŸ’ƒ
